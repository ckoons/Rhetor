# Rhetor Implementation - Phase 1 Completed

## What's Been Implemented

### Architecture
- Created a **single-port architecture** that serves both HTTP and WebSocket endpoints
- Implemented a unified API approach that reduces complexity and port usage
- Set up FastAPI application with CORS support and proper error handling

### Provider System
- Created abstract provider interface (`LLMProvider`) as a base for all implementations
- Implemented `AnthropicProvider` for Claude API support
- Implemented `OpenAIProvider` for GPT API support
- Implemented `OllamaProvider` for local LLM support
- Added `SimulatedProvider` for testing and fallback when no real LLMs are available

### LLM Management
- Created `LLMClient` to manage all providers and handle model selection
- Implemented graceful fallback mechanisms between providers
- Added support for both streaming and non-streaming responses
- Created context-sensitive model routing

### Routing System
- Implemented `ModelRouter` for intelligent model selection based on task type
- Added JSON configuration for task-specific model selection
- Created component-specific routing rules
- Added support for overriding routing at request time

### Context Management
- Implemented `ContextManager` for tracking conversation history
- Added support for persistent storage of contexts (local and Engram)
- Created provider-specific message formatting
- Added full context history retrieval

### Interaction Methods
- Implemented RESTful API for standard HTTP requests
- Added Server-Sent Events for streaming responses
- Implemented WebSockets for real-time bidirectional communication
- Created chat-specific endpoints for multi-message interactions

### Integration
- Added Hermes registration for service discovery
- Created entrypoint scripts for running the server
- Added a test script for verifying the installation
- Updated the README with usage instructions

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

### Context and Template Management
- Enhance the context manager with semantic retrieval
- Implement persistent vector storage for efficient context recall
- Create robust template system for prompts
- Develop component-specific system prompt templates

### Integration Testing
- Test with other Tekton components (especially Ergon, Terma, Hephaestus)
- Test fallback mechanisms under load
- Stress test with concurrent connections

### Script Updates
- Update Tekton scripts to use Rhetor instead of LLM Adapter
- Add proper port management
- Implement graceful shutdown and monitoring
