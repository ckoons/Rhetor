# Handoff Document for Next Claude Code Session

## Current Situation
You are continuing the Rhetor AI Integration Sprint. Phase 3 (Cross-Component Integration) has been completed successfully. The MCP tools are now connected to live Rhetor components and working properly.

## What Was Just Completed (Phase 3)
- Connected MCP tools to live AISpecialistManager instance
- Fixed critical coroutine handling bug in FastMCP endpoints
- Created integration module for tool-to-component communication
- All 22 MCP tools are now functional and tested

## Critical Technical Context

### The Coroutine Bug (SOLVED)
**Problem**: Tools were returning unawaited coroutines causing "coroutine object is not iterable" errors.

**Solution**: In `/Rhetor/rhetor/api/fastmcp_endpoints.py`, changed from:
```python
# OLD (broken) - checking if function is async
if inspect.iscoroutinefunction(tool_func):
    result = await tool_func(**arguments)
else:
    result = tool_func(**arguments)
```

To:
```python
# NEW (working) - always call, then check result
result = tool_func(**arguments)
if inspect.iscoroutine(result):
    result = await result
```

This is because the `@mcp_tool` decorator makes async functions appear as sync to `inspect.iscoroutinefunction()`.

### Key Files Created/Modified
1. `/Rhetor/rhetor/core/mcp/tools_integration.py` - Main integration module
2. `/Rhetor/rhetor/core/mcp/tools.py` - All tools updated to use live integration
3. `/Rhetor/rhetor/api/fastmcp_endpoints.py` - Fixed coroutine handling
4. `/tekton/mcp/fastmcp/utils/endpoints.py` - Updated to support no component_manager
5. `/tekton-core/tekton/mcp/fastmcp/utils/endpoints.py` - Same update

## Testing Status
Run this to verify everything works:
```bash
python /Users/cskoons/projects/github/Tekton/Rhetor/tests/test_mcp_integration.py
```

Should show:
- ✓ MCP service is healthy
- ✓ Found 4 capabilities
- ✓ Found 22 tools
- ✓ All tool executions working

## Next Task: Phase 4 - Advanced Features

### Priority 1: Streaming Support
Implement Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time AI responses:
1. Add SSE endpoint at `/api/mcp/v2/stream`
2. Update tools to support streaming responses
3. Implement in `send_message_to_specialist` first
4. Add progress indicators for long operations

### Priority 2: Dynamic Specialist Creation
1. New endpoint: `POST /api/specialists/create`
2. Template system for specialist configurations
3. Store templates in `/Rhetor/rhetor/templates/specialists/`
4. Hot-reload capability

### Priority 3: Advanced Orchestration
1. Multi-specialist conversation flows
2. Conditional routing based on responses
3. Parallel specialist execution
4. Result aggregation strategies

## Important Warnings

### Import Issues
The `hermes` module may not import correctly. Always use:
```python
try:
    from hermes.core import MessageBus
except ImportError:
    MessageBus = None
```

### Testing Workflow
Always restart Rhetor after changes:
```bash
tekton-kill -c rhetor -y && tekton-launch -c rhetor
```

### Debugging
- Main log: `/Users/cskoons/projects/github/Tekton/.tekton/logs/rhetor.log`
- The debug logging in `process_request_func` is helpful - keep it
- Use `tekton-status -c rhetor` to check if running

## Current Architecture

```
User Request → FastAPI Endpoint → FastMCP Server → Tool Function → MCPToolsIntegration → AISpecialistManager → Response
                                                          ↓
                                                   (if no integration)
                                                          ↓
                                                    Mock Response
```

## Useful Commands
```bash
# Check if Rhetor is running
tekton-status -c rhetor

# View logs
tail -f /Users/cskoons/projects/github/Tekton/.tekton/logs/rhetor.log

# Test specific tool
curl -X POST http://localhost:8003/api/mcp/v2/process \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"tool_name": "ListAISpecialists", "arguments": {}}'
```

## Questions for User
When you start, you might want to ask:
1. Should we proceed with Phase 4 (Streaming Support)?
2. Any preference on SSE vs WebSocket for streaming?
3. Want to review the Phase 3 implementation first?

Good luck! The foundation is solid and all tests are passing.
